    "In this phase, we want to explore the directory and provide a detailed analysis of its structure and contents. It is important to remark that files are named based on the protocol and the attack type; in some cases there are multiple files concerning the same protocol and attack type, for this reason they have been numerated starting from zero.  In order to avoid unbalance in data sampling, the following code allows us to group files based on unique base names. In this way, we obtain 19 files, 18 of which about attacks and 1 about benign data. \n",

The code below allows for identifying all CSV files in the directory and grouping them by their base names. For each group containing more than one file, the function reads the files, concatenates them into a single DataFrame by merging their contents row-wise, and saves the resulting file back into the directory using the base name.\n"
